// Your code here
// create array with first 5 multiples of 2
let arr = [];
for (let i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
    arr.push(2 * i);
}

// find middle element
let n = arr.length;
let val = arr[Math.floor((n - 1) / 2)];

// console.log array and middle element
// console.log("Array:", arr);
// console.log("Middle element:", val);
